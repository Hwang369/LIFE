# Buy a home 买一套房
* Who doesn't dream of owning their own home?The recession and widespread foreclosures over the past few years may have tarnished the dream a bit,but it's still alive and well for most people.Renting may offer more flexibility and variety,but there's nothing quite like having a place of your own.
* 有谁不梦想拥有一套属于自己的房子呢？过去几年中经济的衰退和普遍的取消抵押品赎回权也许让这个梦想变得有些暗淡，但对于大多数人来说这个梦想依然存在。租房也兴许更加灵活多样，但绝对比不上拥有一个属于你自己的地方。
